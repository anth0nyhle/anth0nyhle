## Hello, I’m Tony 👋

I have a PhD in Biomechanical Engineering with expertise in leveraging biomechanics, robotics, and data science to drive innovation in medical devices and health technologies. I also have a Graduate Certificate in Deep Learning in AI & Robotics, with advanced coursework in machine learning, deep learning, data visualization, and medical robotics.

My career goal is to leverage robotics and data science to address real-world problems and create positive impact, particularly for disadvantaged and underrepresented communities.

I am seeking opportunities as a research engineer, product development engineer, clinical development engineer, or systems engineer in medical robotics, medical devices, or health technology.
