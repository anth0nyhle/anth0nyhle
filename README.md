## Hello, Iâ€™m Tony ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate research assistant at the University of Utah, pursuing a PhD in biomedical engineering (expected 2025). I mainly write code in MATLAB and Python to process and analyze scientific data.

My PhD research aims to develop a robotic simulator to study the kinematic mechanisms of the ankle and hindfoot joints and how different arthrodeses affect their functionality. This work combines biomechanics, robotics, controls, and machine learning to provide a unique interdisciplinary approach to understanding foot and ankle function.

My career goal is to leverage robotics and data science to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact, particularly in disadvantaged and underrepresented communities.

I am interested in roles as a data scientist, robotics engineer, or clinical development/research engineer within medical robotics, medical devices, or health technology.
