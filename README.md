## Hello, Iâ€™m Tony ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate research assistant at the University of Utah, pursuing a PhD in biomedical engineering (expected 2025). I mainly write code in MATLAB and R to process and analyze scienific data. I am currently expanding my Python skills to introduce applications of data science and machine learning into my work.

My PhD research focuses on foot and ankle orthopaedic biomechanics, specifically using a robotic simulator and cadaveric model to study the individual joint kinematic envelopes in the foot and ankle.

My overall career goal is to leverage engineering and data science to solve real-world problems in healthcare, sustainable development, climate, and/or the environment.
