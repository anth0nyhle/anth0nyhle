## Hello, Iâ€™m Tony ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate research assistant at the University of Utah, pursuing a PhD in biomedical engineering (expected 2025). I mainly write code in MATLAB and R to process and analyze scientific data. I am currently expanding my Python skills to introduce applications of data science and machine learning into my work.

My PhD research is focused on foot and ankle orthopaedic biomechanics, specifically developing a robotic simulator to study the individual ankle and hindfoot joint kinematics and their interactions in a human cadaveric model.

My overall career goal is to utilize robotics and machine learning to solve real-world problems and make positive impacts in society, especially in disadvantaged communities.

I am interested in working as a research/data/machine learning scientist in medical robotics, health technology, sustainability, or climate technology.
